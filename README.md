# Interpretable Clustering on Dynamic Graphs with Recurrent Graph Neural Networks

This repository is the official implementation of Interpretable Clustering on Dynamic Graphs with Recurrent Graph Neural Networks(https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08740). 

>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials
## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
run python
pip install tensorflow-gpu
pip install tensoflow_addons
pip install numpy
pip install spektral
```

To run non model main:

```setup
run python 3.6
pip install dgl-cu101
pip install dynamicgem
pip install keras==2.2.4
pip install torch
pip install --user scipy==1.4.1
pip install sklearn
```

These are seperate because dynamicgem has a lot of specific dependencies that make it incompatible with the original environment

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...
## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run:

```train
main.ipynb
```

To train models which don't need to be trained in the paper, run:
```train
non model main.ipynb
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.
## Evaluation

To evaluate the model(s) in the paper, run:

```train
main.ipynb
```

To evaluate models which don't need to be trained in the paper, run:
```train
non model main.ipynb
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).
## Pre-trained Models:

Pre-trained Models are not available yet. Models take around 5 minutes to train.

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.
## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :
